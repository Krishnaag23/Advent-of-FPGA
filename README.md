## Advent of FPGA 
This repository contains my attempt at solving the advent of code 2025 challenge with Hardcaml, a DSL embedded in OCaml. 
It is also my submission for [JaneStreet Advent of FPGA](https://blog.janestreet.com/advent-of-fpga-challenge-2025/) challenge. 

### Resources 
Here is a chronological list of resources that I referred, to learn more about Ocaml and Hardcaml. This should prove useful for 
beginners learning Hardcaml, as I have basic knowledge of Digital design and Verilog at the start of this.
